# Project Sketches
After the prototyping activities in class, I liked one sketch for visualizing student progress in a course, and developed mid-fidelity mockups for this visualization.

## Overview
The main audience for this visualization would be teachers using standards-based grading systems. For now, it would mainly be used by myself, but the hope is that I could generalize this for other teachers to use as well. At first glance, I can see the overall mastery of each standard for a specific student in a specific course.

## Tasks
Below are examples of how a teacher could interact with the visualization to perform some tasks.

### Get Information About a Standard
Upon hovering over a standard, the teacher will be able to see more information, such as what the standard code represents.

### View Another Student
A dropdown menu allows the teacher to see the overview for another student.

### Pan and Zoom
By dragging and scrolling on the screen, the teacher can zoom in on specific domains and standards.

### View Another Course
A dropdown menu allows the teacher to see the overview for another course.
