## Data Visualization
Making information accessible  
	â€¢ Aggregation, analysis, visualization

Why interactive?  
[Hans Rosling - The Best Stats You've Ever Seen][hans]

### Object Constancy
Idea of a constant object (data point, person, etc) that we can follow along through a story / visualization

### Examples
  - [NYT Class and Racism](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html)
  - [Visual Intro to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
  - d3 bar chart race (of tech company market share)

In these examples you can follow (via color, label, shape) one object throughout the interactivity
