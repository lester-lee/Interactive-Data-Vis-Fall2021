## Abstract
from prospectus

## Data
Technical documentation sharing with the reader what data you used, where you found it (or how you generated it), and what analysis/manipulations (if any) you performed.

## Process
sketches
early iterations
screenshots

## Reflection
Your reflection should be roughly 1,000-1,500 words, and reflect on any/all of  the following:

    Outline the major design decisions you made for your visuals, explain how you got there and why you picked them.
    If you were to develop your own design process, how would it differ or mirror the design process taught in class?
    What was the most helpful thing you learned from your project? From your tutorials?
    How did the critiques affect your project and how you think about it?
    How did your final project differ from the prospectus you outlined?
    What were your major challenges? How would you mitigate them with your next project?
    If you had more time and resources, what would you add/remove/change about your project?
